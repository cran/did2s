Description: Estimates Two-way Fixed Effects difference-in-differences/event-study models using the approach proposed by Gardner (2021). To avoid the problems caused by OLS estimation of the Two-way Fixed Effects model, this function first estimates the fixed effects and covariates using untreated observations and then in a second stage, estimates the treatment effects.
